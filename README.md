# horizontalIvaders
Arduino duo game. 
First "Real game' I've ever made. Found it much more fun to actually put together your own hardaware and (screen, buttons etc.) And have my game run on an indepented machine apart from my computer. Really loving low level dev even tho this fairly basic for now.
